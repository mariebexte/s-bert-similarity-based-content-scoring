26311,dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.,2,1
26344,white :: if they pick white then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the darker colors like bla ck and gray take in more heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in less heat and energy so therefor Brandi and Jerry should pick a dark c olor,1,0
26350,white :: white can reflect more heat then black becaus e black absorbs more heat,1,0
26365,white :: they should paint the dog house white because its is a light color and attracts less heat the black lid got the highest tempature showing they should not use black pain because it attra cts heat,1,2
26371,white :: so it dosent get hot in the house,1,0
26373,"dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler.",1,0
26378,dark gray ::  I choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot. The results showed that the highest temputure was 48(DEG)C and the lowerest was 48(DEG)C.,1,2
26397,"white :: The experiment shows that if the color is whi te, the less hot the object gets. So if Brandi and Jerry paint it white t he dog would not be as hot if it was black.",1,0
26407,white :: This way the doghouse will stay cool since th e jar with the white lid had the average temperature or 42(DEG) C.,1,2
26410,"light gray :: Light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse. One reason I chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse, the dog could overheat. Also, the opposite is true as well. If you had a white doghouse, it may make the dog very cold. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C, and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)C. This makes a grey-painted doghouse the best choice.",2,1
26423,"white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse.",2,1
26426,black :: using the results from the experiment the bes t color for the doghouse if you were looking for the doghouse to be warm would be black because in the experiment it shows that black heats up the most in the same amunt of time.,2,1
26433,white :: I think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat.,2,1
26437,light gray ::  I chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. The light gray rose 21(DEG)C in ten minutes where as the black rose 29(DEG)C and th at means that when it's hot outside the tempature in the dog house will b e hot and uncomfortable.,2,1
26453,light gray :: If you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog,1,0
26456,"black ::  How the color might affect the doghouse is by the temperature of the inside of the doghouse. With the proven fact by the experim ent that darker colors absorb more heat, painting the doghouse the color black will increase the temperature of inside the doghouse. In the experi ment, Brandi and Jerry got the results that the color black (out of all the colors) had the hottest temperature of the inside of the glass jar.",1,2

26487,dark gray :: i how not mack the dog house black it will be to hot,1,0
26488,white :: It will make the air cooler becuase it's aver age was 42. It started at 24 so it only went up by 18 and black went up b y 29 because black ended at 53.,2,1
26499,black :: If they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold.,2,1
26503,white ::  White would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house. It would stay at a temperature of about 42(DEG)C. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. So I think this would be the best choice.,0,1
26521,"black ::  Black would make the doghouse warm inside. In the experiment, the average temperature for black jars was 53(DEG)C",2,1
26524,light gray ::  it will put some heat in but will also keep i t cool in the day,1,0
26540,"white :: White might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white, in the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees C. When black increased by 30 or so degrees C.",2,1
26543,"black ::  I chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer. If they paint the dog house white, the light will just reflect off, butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm, I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but the average temperature with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. So black would be the best color for the dog house.",2,1

26557,"light gray ::  In the test results the white at the average of 42(DEG)C was the coolest while black at the average of 53(DEG)C was the hottest. While light gray is averiging 45(DEG)c, it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog.",2,1
26572,"white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle.",2,1
26573,"white :: White would be the best color. this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside, so it asorbed or blocked the most heat, it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees",1,2
26578,white :: because white is the the color that regects a ll light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat,0,1
26579,"light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG).",2,1
26582,"white ::  Assuming that you want to keep the doghouse c ool, i would choose to paint it white because it reflects the least amoun t of light.",0,1
26596,"dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray, because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside. Dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, so the temperature will keep the dog warm, but not too hot.",1,2
26598,white :: the color should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out.,0,1
26599,"white ::  Using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun , refurring back to the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment, we know that whi te absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42(DEG) after 10 minutes, t hat is only 18(DEG)C more than the temperature it started at (24(DEG) C). This is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house.",1,2
26601,dark gray ::  the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other. Plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill,0,1
26604,dark gray ::  it will keep same temp. and will be too hot nor cold,1,0
26644,white :: white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42(DEG) c it will keep the dog comfortable.,2,1
26648,"white :: The color will reflect most of the heat and t he inside of the doghouse will stay cooler. In the experament, the temper ature of the jar with the white lid only was raised an average of 16(DEG) C.",1,2
26659,light gray :: It wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between.The highest tempature would be to hot because its 54(DEG) an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41(DEG) and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold.,1,2
26660,"black :: If the dog house had a black roof, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For example, in the winter time or when it is cold out, the black roof keeps all of the dog's body heat in the house, instead of wasting it. And in the summer, when it's hot, he'll be outside playing, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much .",0,1
26667,"light gray :: Light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house, because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would.",0,1
26711,black ::  Black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs.,0,1
26712,light gray :: they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog.,0,1
26715,dark gray :: in winter the doghouse will stay warm in the summer the doghouse will stay cool.,1,0
26720,dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color.Dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature.Dark grey would be the bes t because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53(DEG)c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an a verage of 42(DEG)c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48(DEG)c. The light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45(DEG)c.The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3(DEG)c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it g ot colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog.,2,1
26726,white ::  i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot.,1,0
26731,"white :: White has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color. Like their hypothesis said ""Darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors"". So white is the ligh test color there is. So that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black, dark gray, and light gray doghouses.",2,1

27521,dark gray :: dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog. in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48. there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm,1,1
27522,"white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.",2,2
27524,black :: The darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be. The lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside,1,1
27525,white :: it will keep the temp. in the 40(DEG) area ( C(DEG)) and not burn up the dog inside the dog-house.,0,0
27526,white ::  The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause the dog won't get too hot in the summer because the weather is warme r in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four. White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees.,2,2
27527,light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color. It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog. During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53(DEG)C. The white lid created a temperature of 42(DEG)C. Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium.,2,2
27528,"white :: White might affect the inside of the dog hous e because, it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature. I th ink white is the best paint color to use because, it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy.",2,2
27529,"white ::  white would make the dog house less hot. the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1,2, and 3.",2,2
27530,white :: becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house,0,0
27531,"white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color.",2,2
27532,light gray :: light gray how it might affect the doghouse i s that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color mi ght get really hot well the dog house might get really hot.,0,0
27534,"white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius.",2,2
27535,light gray ::  Based on the data I think light grey would be the best color. I think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer.,1,1
27536,light gray :: A light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house. The average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C which is too hot and the dark gray was 48(DEG)C which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45(DEG)C and the white was 42(DEG)C so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house.,1,1
27537,"white :: The white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse, meaning it would be great for summer. But if yo u want the warmer house in the winter, the black doghouse should do the t rick.",1,1
27538,black ::  Really black.,0,0
27540,white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.,1,1
27544,white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.,2,2
27545,white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.,1,1
27546,"black ::  The color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because, you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer. There will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature.",1,1
27547,black ::  it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller,1,1
27548,"white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.",1,1
27549,"light gray ::  this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it, but not overheating the doghouse.",1,1
27550,white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog,1,1
27552,white :: The dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat.,1,1
27553,white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors,2,2
27555,"white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.",2,2
27556,"dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C.

27558,white :: white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light,1,1
27559,white ::  The black was 9(DEG) C warmer then the white colored paint. The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog. The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.,2,2
27560,white :: painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11(DEG)C. the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53(DEG)C where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42(DEG)C.,2,2
27563,white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.,0,0

27565,light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.,1,1
27566,"light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.",2,2
27567,white :: i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white.,1,1
27568,light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.,2,2
27570,"black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.",2,2
27572,white :: white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house,1,1
27573,dark gray :: it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm,1,1
27575,"light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm.",1,1
27576,"white :: The white paint color would be cooler becaus e on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot, so the dog would just g o in his dog house. The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat. Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun. The experiment tells it all, the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40(DEG)c as the other colors went up to 45, 48, and 53. The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest. Coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house.",2,2
27577,black :: White would keep the doghouse the coldest (ar ound 40). If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties. If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties. If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties.
